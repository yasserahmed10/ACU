# Student Benefits

The following are some benefits of ACU:

1. If you want to self-study because your university or a course -at your university- isn't that great, you can check [Self-taught Benefits](./Self-Taught-Benefits.md).
2. Compensate bad/no community/services at your university.
3. Gain connections. In addition to the same point in [Self-taught Benefits](./Self-Taught-Benefits.md):
   1. Community is an additional channel to gain connections from outside your university or area.
   2. Community can be a channel to reach people who you wouldn't normally reach at your university or area if it gets familiar enough. This only happened when everyone shared and put effort into the old/regional community.
